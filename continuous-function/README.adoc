# Gradle example for Muon Java

This example project shows how to make a couple of simple Muon services
and have them communicate.

First, check the project compiles, downloading gradle automatically via the gradle wrapper
embedded in the project.

```
./gradlew assemble
```

## Before You Start

This project is configured to use the AMQP discovery and transport for Muon.

You will need an AMQP broker available that you can connnect to.

You can set the AMQP url to connect in the https://github.com/microserviceux/muon-java-gradle-example/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file

## Run the server

The first service has an RPC endpoint and a reactive stream endpoint.

Run it in one console with :-

```
./gradlew runServer
```


## Run the client

In a _different_ console, run the client and see an RPC exchange between the services.

```
./gradlew runClient
```
