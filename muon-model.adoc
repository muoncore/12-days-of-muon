Microservices based on Messaging
NOT SEDA style messaging where the broker and the queue is the primary concept. This is point to point services that know of each others existence.

messages implement technical co-ordination between 1..N services. Part of that technical co-ordination will likely pass messages that contain application data. From the Muon model point of view, these messages are not special.
