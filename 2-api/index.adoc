TIP: This guide is maintained at https://github.com/muoncore/12-days-of-muon Please submit issues at that repository.

Today, you will

* Finish the Menu API
* Build an Order API
* Have it interact with the Menu API
* Create reactive data flows between services

This last item is important. Understanding how data should move in a Reactive system is the most important lesson when
building Microservices that will be able to tolerate network distribution and the various fun failure modes that comes with that.

## Implement the Menu Microservice

Imagine a Pie Shop (a nice one!). You have tables, people looking at the menu, nice plants in the corner, the works

This is a advanced shop, and so at each of the tables is a tablet showing the current menu.

Given the boutique nature of the shop, the Menu is constantly updated through the day as the kitchen
makes Pies and they are eaten, so reducing stock again.

The Menu needs to be able to show the various items available, their prices and be able to recieve
push updates whenever these change.

To implement these, you need to update the service you created in part one, replacing its endpoints:

* Get the current state as a request/ response, aka RPC. In clients, you will use this to get the initial state of the menu, and also
any time you need to ad hoc query it.
* Have current state always be up to date. This endpoint will push updates from the Menu to subscribed clients
using the Reactive Stream protocol. This will allow you to distribute low latency updates to all clients.

We will implement updating the Menu state in the next episode of the series.

.Introspection
****
Muon is built to enable you to use multiple protocols. Given that, you are going to need a way to understand what a service is able to do for you.

Since Muon is focused on communication and data models, it's approach is generally "the answer is a protocol, what's the question?"

The answer in Muon is the _Introspection Protocol_. This is a simple interaction that allows you to interrogate a remote system
to see what it is capable of doing for you.

To call it via the CLI, execute `muon introspect [servicename]`

This is also available in the Muon SDK apis.

Try that now on your running menu microservice to see the protocol endpoints you have already made.

### Internal Data

We need a menu data structure to work with, we'll use Java classes for these in Java land.

Create a `MenuItem` class, like so:

TODO, replace
[source,java]
----
include::../../submodules/java/doc/src/main/java/io/muoncore/example/guide/Menu.java[lines=2..-1]
----
<1> Construct a configuration for Muon. Here using all the defaults and call the service `menu`
<1> Using the configuration, build a running Muon instance
<1> Create an RPC protocol request handler. This uses `all()`, which matches any incoming request
<1> Create a new reactive streaming endpoint named `mysource`
<1> Use an RxJava2 as the source for the endpoint.


Then, create a `CurrentMenu` class, like so:

TODO, replace
[source,java]
----
include::../../submodules/java/doc/src/main/java/io/muoncore/example/guide/Menu.java[lines=2..-1]
----
<1> Construct a configuration for Muon. Here using all the defaults and call the service `menu`
<1> Using the configuration, build a running Muon instance
<1> Create an RPC protocol request handler. This uses `all()`, which matches any incoming request
<1> Create a new reactive streaming endpoint named `mysource`
<1> Use an RxJava2 as the source for the endpoint.


These will form the local state of the Menu.

### RPC Endpoint - /

Create a new variable within `Menu` to hold the current menu. Then update the RPC endpoint
to send it in the response.

TODO, update
[source,java]
----
include::../../submodules/java/doc/src/main/java/io/muoncore/example/guide/Menu.java[lines=2..-1]
----

<1> Create an RPC protocol request handler. This uses `all()`, which matches any incoming request
<1> Create a new reactive streaming endpoint named `mysource`
<1> Use an RxJava2 as the source for the endpoint.


### Stream Endpoint - /

Next, you need to update the stream endpoint to send the state of the menu every time it is updated.

There are multiple methods for doing this, depending on which FRP library you use to implement
your service internals (Muon takes no position on what's best in that field, only caring that
they implement Reactive Streams).

Assuming you stick with RxJava2, one way to implement this would be to push the current state into an RxJava
`Subject`.

The following code will create a new streaming endpoint that, whenever a new item of data is pushed
into the subject, distribute the Menu to all subscribers.

Since we don't yet have a mechanism to update the menu, you can simulate it for now, using a thread
that periodically updates the state and pushes the new data out. We will fix this in the next episode

TODO, update
[source,java]
----
include::../../submodules/java/doc/src/main/java/io/muoncore/example/guide/Menu.java[lines=2..-1]
----
<1> Construct a configuration for Muon. Here using all the defaults and call the service `menu`
<1> Using the configuration, build a running Muon instance
<1> Create an RPC protocol request handler. This uses `all()`, which matches any incoming request
<1> Create a new reactive streaming endpoint named `mysource`
<1> Use an RxJava2 as the source for the endpoint.

Now we have a system inside the Menu service that allows us to keep the data internally consistent,
and for remote clients to both query and keep an up to date local copy in their own memory.

Next, we will build that service!

## Create the Order Microservice

Next up, we want to be able to take orders.  To build this, we will use Node.js (go Polyglot!)

The API for an Order is an RPC endpoint. Take a request, process, send response back when done.

The complexity comes from the interaction between the Order and Menu services. How should we
have the communicate?

The easy way is to have Order make an RPC call to the Menu, getting the state each time. This
would add latency and some fragility to the service though. What happens if the Menu service goes down?

Here you have CAP theorum choice to make. Do you want to build a consistent, yet fragile system,
and so always check the Menu at source, or do you want to build an available system that could make the occasional
inconsistent data decision?

In our case, we will choose AP (because I always choose AP where possible, otherwise why are you building
Microservices?)

The impact on our system is that the Order service will be able to place orders while the Menu service
is down. The cost of this is that the Order service may place orders against an out of date Menu, either stock
or price. This would only be the case if the Menu service is completely unavailable.

To do this, you will subscribe to the streaming endpoint on the Menu service and effectively keep
a representation of the Menu data within the Order service. This gives us some nice advantages.
Scale will be much easier, all the data is now local, and in memory. We can rework the data structure to make
it more amenable for Order processing. If the stream connection is lost, we still have that data in memory until the Menu
service comes back up, at which point the service reconnects and gets back in sync

### Create the Microservice

First, install NPM and node as at http://npmjs.org

Once you have a working installation, create a new directory called 'orders' and then create a new npm project in there
using `npm init`

Once you have done that, add a dependency for muon

```
npm install muon-core --save
```

Create a new file as the entry point, `index.js`

### Get the Menu Data

### Create the Order API

## Summary

You now have two Microservices that interact in a Reactive way. You have seen eventual consistency,
the benefits of streaming data and how to build an AP system.

In the next episode of the series, you will add data persistence and distribution to your services in the form of
event streams using a dedicated Microservice, Photon.
