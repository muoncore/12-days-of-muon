Today, you will

* get a development environment setup, including the cli
* See some helper services we provide to make things easier
* build a couple of microservices
* have them do something useful

## Setting up your Environment

Muon is not demanding of you development environment. You can use your regular IDE, and your language and
frameworks of choice, so long as the language runtime is currently supported.

One thing that is necessary is support for the network transport that Muon services will use to communicate with
each other.

Currently, AMQP is best supported, and so that is what we will use.

Aside from that, you don't need anything else to develop Muon services.

That said, we provide a set of Microservices that give a set of basic functionality that we find is often wanted.

These are (as of writing):-

* Photon - an Event Store and Projection engine
* Molecule - a pluggable React based UI

These, along with RabbitMQ, give the base environment we recommend for you to get started developing Muon services.

We provide two main routes to get them, a Docker Compose environment, and a Vagrant VM that wraps the Docker Compose environment.

.libMuon
****
If you language is not currently supported, come and join the libMuon effort!

This is implementing Muon in a native Rust library, with support for bindings into many other languages.

When complete, we will have very broad language capability, and full interoperability with the existing Muon
libraries and services.

https://github.com/muoncore/libmuon

### Installing the Base Services using Docker Compose

Go to https://github.com/muoncore/muon-starter and follow the instructions there.

once complete, you will have the services running, you can check them with the CLI (installed below)
or by visiting the Molecule UI at http://localhost:3420

### Installing the Base Services using Vagrant

_This is awaiting a stable vagrant build_

### Installing the CLI

Muon provides a CLI. You install this using *npm*, from the Node.js environment.

You do not need to code in JavaScript or use node beyond this if you don't want to, but it is currently required
to use the CLI.

Install NPM (as at https://www.npmjs.com/)

Then install muon using

```bash
> npm install -g muon-cli
```

Check it's working using the `discover` commmand, or it's short version `d`. This will list
 all of the currently running Muon services.

You will need to set the MUON_URL environment variable first, which tells Muon how to connect to the
network transport/ discovery service. In this case, RabbitMQ

```
> export MUON_URL=amqp://muon:microservices@localhost
> muon d
```

Once this works, you have a running CLI, and you can begin to interrogate what the services can do.

Likely, you only have Photon and Molecule running.

Let's build some more!

## Building a multi protocol API

We are building a Pie shop management system. We will start designing and building proper services
in the next section. Today though, we just want to get something running.

Often, the easiest way to get started with a system is to define the _queries_ that you need to make.
Without concerning yourself with changing data, we can effectively stub out the data we want to provide.

With Muon, we have the opportunity to incorporate multiple different protocols to make our API.

Built in, we can use RPC for simple request/ response, and Reactive Streaming, for streaming push updates.

For this API, we will build an API for the _Menu_.

This will be ultimately be made available on the web, on tabletop displays and wait staff mobile devices
(although we won't build a mobile app in this tutorial!)

In this case, the data set is small, and so instead of providing granular APIs, we will request the entire
data set and process it in local memory to get the best performance and tolerate network failure.

We will provide two endpoints, one RPC and the other Stream. This will allow clients to get the current state,
and also receive push updates whenever we update the menu data

### Muon Java Microservice

The Menu service, we will write in _Java_. To get started wth this, download Gradle.

Try using link:http://sdkman.io/[SDKMan]

#### Create the build file

Create a new Gradle build file as below.

[souce,groovy]
----
include::{includedir}/menu/build.gradle[]
----
<1> We use the Spring Boot gradle plugin to give us easy uberjar and app distribution
<1> Set the main class for the spring boot plugin run command
<1> Add the Artifactory url where the muon libraries can be found
<1> The latest version of Muon, with the basic libraries for connecting to AMQP.
<1> The current version of RxJava, which we will use to build a streaming endpoint

Create the standard file structure

----

 src/
   main/
      java/
----

#### Create Muon Service class

To start with, we need a single class to put our Muon API in. Later in the series we will separate them
up.

Create the class referenced above `pieshop.Menu` as a regular Java class with a Main method.

like this

[source,java]
----
include::{includedir}/menu/src/main/java/pieshop/Menu.java[]
----
<1> Construct a configuration for Muon. Here using all the defaults and call the service `menu`
<1> Using the configuration, build a running Muon instance
<1> Create an RPC protocol request handler. This uses `all()`, which matches any incoming request
<1> Create a new reactive streaming endpoint named `mysource`
<1> Use an RxJava2 as the source for the endpoint.

This can be run using the `bootRun` command from the Spring Boot Gradle plugin

```
> gradle bootRun
```

You can then make a request to the service using the CLI and recieve `hello world` in return

```
> muon rpc rpc://menu/
```

You can subscribe to the stream endpoint like so

----
> muon stream stream://menu/mysource
'Hello'
'World'
'Item'
----

The subscription will request and print all items, then when the source `Flowable` sends the complete signal,
the cli will cleanly exit.


.Make as a Common Build Tool
****
You will notice that all of the projects, including the starter above, use `Make` as the entry point.

This is by design. We are going to be crossing between multiple build tools, invoking various forms
of build, test, release, deploy and so on. Each tool has different requirements, and some of the phases
aren't always necessary.

Remembering all of this will be a pain. So, we use make, and standardise the targets. This gives you somewhere
to start figuring out how the build tool doing the heavy lifting underneath wants to be run.

## Summary

You now have a Muon environment ready to build services with. You will be building lots of them.

In the next episode of the series, you will:

* Create a set of microservices that form the API of the shop.
* Understand how to use the two protocols above to service the data in different forms.
