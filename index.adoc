## 12 Days of Muon

Muon is a set of projects that facilitate the building of Microservices and distributed systems.

It is designed to enable you to build new, rich programming models that allow distributed communication beyond what is normally
available using standard integration technologies such as HTTP or messaging.

This is done by defining _Protocols_, and creating Microservices that back those protocols to provide rich functionality.

Protocols are well defined message based interactions, such as Eventing, Reactive Streams, Auctions and many other possibilities.

The end result is the ability to create systems that express complex interactions in a manageable way, and can be composed
together, like software "Lego"

This is a series of intro articles and videos that will guide you through building a full system with UI - Ye Olde Muon Pie Shoppe

If you want to get involved in developing Muon itself, see link:getting-involved.html[Getting Involved]

In this series, we will build up a full example system - a retail system that can be used to run
a pie shop.
This is a shop, that sells pies. It sells them over the counter to customers, taking orders, auto managing stock, sending cooking
instructions to the kitchen and updating the menu in real time.
